# Extract-sub-list
This program is prompts the user to enter 10 numbers and then asks for the indices of the sub-list they want to extract. It handles cases where the first index is greater than the second by swapping them. The selected sub-list is then displayed, and the user has the option to enter a new list or exit the program.
